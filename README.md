### Features:
+ Lightweight, Simple, Fast (no external libraries/frameworks needed).
+ Remembers previous context/history.

+ Multiple chats (although should be noted that its not quite stable yet, but for the most part it should work).

### Disadvantages:
- Not as fast as tgpt (obviously its written in Web languages such as HTML,CSS,JS, and the browser uses lots of RAM).
