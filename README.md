### Features:
+ Lightweight, Simple, Fast (no external libraries/frameworks needed).
+ Remembers previous context/history.
+ self-hostable, no installation required (because its written in Web languages, just open the file/site).

### Disadvantages:
- Not as fast as tgpt (obviously its written in Web languages such as HTML,CSS,JS, and because of it, it/the browser uses lots of RAM).
- Can't do multiple chats yet (backend code does "support" multiple chat, but its not ready yet, and there is no way to change it through GUI).

### Size comparison:
+ ChatGPT web client: 2.8mb
+ BAI Chat web client: 3.23mb
+ tgpt terminal client: 6.9mb (compiled binary for linux-amd64)
+ tgpt terminal client: 6kb (source code)
+ GPT Lite web client: 20kb
