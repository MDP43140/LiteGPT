### Features:
+ Lightweight, Simple, Fast (no external libraries/frameworks needed).
+ Remembers previous context/history.
+ self-hostable, no installation required (because its written in Web languages, just open the file/site).
+ Multiple chats (although should be noted that its not quite stable yet, but for the most part it should work).

### Disadvantages:
- Not as fast as tgpt (obviously its written in Web languages such as HTML,CSS,JS, and the browser uses lots of RAM).

+ BAI Chat web client: 3.23mb
+ tgpt terminal client: 6.9mb (compiled binary for linux-amd64)
+ tgpt terminal client: 6kb (source code, library and compiler not included)
